            <p class="newsletter-articles-content-text">
                1. Introduction
            </p>
            
            <p class="newsletter-articles-content-text">
                The University of Makati Educational Development Foundation, Inc. (UMEDFI) is at the stage of repositioning itself as a viable partner of the University of Makati (UMak), in the promotion of educational programs in building human capital towards global sustainable development.   It requires an aggressive develop- mental perspective responsive to the needs of UMak attuned to the demands and challenges of the 21st century.  Faculty excellence as the core strategy for development requires financial stability to be able to promote a culture of scholarship, innovation and leadership to be able to achieve its vision and mission.
            </p>
            
            <p class="newsletter-articles-content-text">
                The UMEDFI, in partnership with UMak has a great role in developing professionals through a strong cadre of faculty members in the areas of instruction, research and community service.  The continued search for an array of opportunities for faculty’s growth and development is underway to be able to provide them options for academic scholarships, training, research, community service, observation tours, benchmarking activities and other modalities which faculty members can take advantage of in the development of their competencies and linkages around the globe.  Eventually, the outcomes will redound to the development of employable graduates, otherwise known as the builders of the land, both here and abroad who will serve as multipliers in pursuit to the economic and social growth of the society in general.
            </p>
            <p class="newsletter-articles-content-text">
            The roadmap is aimed at organizational and program expansion inclusive of tested traditional and non-traditional or emerging strategies.   Factors considered in crafting this roadmap:  (1) a by-product of the Board of Directors meetings as influenced by the dynamics of an evolving environment with the advancement of technology, knowledge explosion and globalization, among others; (2) the vision and mission of the University of Makati; (3) the January 2025 Strategic Planning Session that provided a 3D analysis of strengths and weaknesses of factors impinging into the operations of the UMEDFI; and (4) commitment to standards of practices in the management of the Foundation.
