            <p>
                The partnership between UMEDFI and the University of Makati was officially established through a Memorandum of Agreement executed on December 15, 2011, and amended on August 1, 2012. These were ratified by the Executive Committee/Board of Regents and recorded in Resolution No. 2011-161 and Resolution No. 2016-148. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary aim of the MOA is for both parties to collaboratively operate and administer executive degree and non-degree courses, postgraduate programs, and other academic offerings for a specific niche market not traditionally addressed by the University. The objective is to establish a partnership by consolidating resources among the contracting parties.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Strategic Initiative</h2>
            <p>
                The UMEDFI is a strategic initiative developed under the guidance of the then University President, Prof. Tomas B. Lopez, Jr., to tackle educational and academic opportunities beyond the University’s conventional constituency. To achieve this goal, UMEDFI provides innovative but fundamental market-priced academic courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                This strategy aims to alleviate limitations and promote faculty development, essential for the University’s long-term competitiveness, by establishing a mechanism to provide high-quality courses that may be unattainable within the university. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Program Development and Partnerships</h2>
            <p>
                With a decade of experience in program administration, UMEDFI has successfully established significant partnerships and initiated innovative academic and non-academic programs in local government leadership, business management, equivalency programs, and training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two UMak colleges distinguished themselves by the programs they initiated:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The College of Governance and Public Policy (CGPP) has graduated numerous local leaders at both the master's and undergraduate levels across the country.</li>
                <li>The College of Business and Business Financial Sciences finalized its offerings for an Accelerated Master of Business Administration (MBA) program and has completed an equivalency program for companies involved in BPO and Microfinance initiatives.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Board of Directors</h2>
            <p>
                To date, the UMEDFI Board of Directors is composed of nine (9) members and its officers.
