            <p>
                The conference meeting of UMEDFI on Saturday, February 8, was enriched with an insightful talk about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) led by guest speaker Mr. Max G. Ventura through his presentation “Voluntary or Voluntold?: A Case for Doing Good While Doing Well”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Introduced by Ms. Elaine Go, auditor of UMEDFI, Mr. Ventura is the National Director of Aid to the Church in Need (ACN), an ESG Consultant to AIA Philippines, a former Director of Philam Foundation, and an owner of an ESG and CSR consultancy service with two decades of experience in Corporate Governance, Corporate Volunteering, and Social Responsibility. He provided the board with a deeper understanding of CSR and volunteerism through the activities of the Philam Foundation, resulting in engaging dialogues.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simplified as "Espresso of CSR: Doing Good While Doing Well", he emphasized that organizations should consider Edward Freeman's Stakeholder's Theory and the Quintuple Bottom Line; People, Planet, Profit, Purpose, and Prosperity in their core business operations to strive a more balanced and sustainable position as a business wherein all stakeholders affected are considered and a more holistic approach is practiced.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This involves the separate aspects of CSR: Corporate Responsibility (the Doing Well), which refers to a business making a profit, and Social Responsibility (the Doing Good), which refers to making the community improve in any way possible, creating a lasting impact on society that sustains a business in the long run.
            </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>
                The engagement with Mr. Ventura became an excellent opportunity for the board to plan the integration of Corporate Social Responsibility and Volunteerism into its core identity, as it continuously aims to create a social impact, aside from aiding Makati City’s education to excellence as a non-profit organization.
